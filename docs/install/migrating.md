summary: "Migration hub: cross-system imports, machine-to-machine moves, and plugin upgrades"

  - You are moving Autopus to a new laptop or server
  - You are coming from another agent system and want to keep state
  - You are upgrading an in-place plugin
title: "Migration guide"

Autopus supports three migration paths: importing from another agent system, moving an existing install to a new machine, and upgrading a plugin in place.

## Import from another agent system

Use the bundled migration providers to bring instructions, MCP servers, skills, model config, and (opt-in) API keys into Autopus. Plans are previewed before any change, secrets are redacted in reports, and apply is backed by a verified backup.

The CLI entry point is [`autopus migrate`](/cli/migrate). Onboarding can also offer migration when it detects a known source (`autopus onboard --flow import`).

## Move Autopus to a new machine

Copy the **state directory** (`~/.autopus/` by default) and your **workspace** to preserve:

- **Config** — `autopus.json` and all gateway settings.
- **Auth** — per-agent `auth-profiles.json` (API keys plus OAuth), plus any channel or provider state under `credentials/`.
- **Sessions** — conversation history and agent state.
- **Channel state** — WhatsApp login, Telegram session, and similar.
- **Workspace files** — `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, skills, and prompts.

<Tip>
Run `autopus status` on the old machine to confirm your state directory path. Custom profiles use `~/.autopus-<profile>/` or a path set via `AUTOPUS_STATE_DIR`.
</Tip>

### Migration steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stop the gateway and back up">
    On the **old** machine, stop the gateway so files are not changing mid-copy, then archive:

    ```bash
    autopus gateway stop
    cd ~
    tar -czf autopus-state.tgz .autopus
    ```

    If you use multiple profiles (for example `~/.autopus-work`), archive each separately.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Autopus on the new machine">
    [Install](/install) the CLI (and Node if needed) on the new machine. It is fine if onboarding creates a fresh `~/.autopus/`. You will overwrite it next.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy state directory and workspace">
    Transfer the archive via `scp`, `rsync -a`, or an external drive, then extract:

    ```bash
    cd ~
    tar -xzf autopus-state.tgz
    ```

    Ensure hidden directories were included and file ownership matches the user that will run the gateway.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run doctor and verify">
    On the new machine, run [Doctor](/gateway/doctor) to apply config migrations and repair services:

    ```bash
    autopus doctor
    autopus gateway restart
    autopus status
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

If Telegram or Discord uses the default env fallback (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`), verify the migrated state-dir `.env` contains those keys without printing the secret values:

```bash
awk -F= '/^(TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN|DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN)=/ { print $1 "=present" }' ~/.autopus/.env
```

`autopus doctor` also warns when an enabled default Telegram or Discord account has no configured token and the matching env variable is unavailable to the doctor process.

### Common pitfalls

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Profile or state-dir mismatch">
    If the old gateway used `--profile` or `AUTOPUS_STATE_DIR` and the new one does not, channels will appear logged out and sessions will be empty. Launch the gateway with the **same** profile or state-dir you migrated, then rerun `autopus doctor`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Copying only autopus.json">
    The config file alone is not enough. Model auth profiles live under `agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`, and channel and provider state lives under `credentials/`. Always migrate the **entire** state directory.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permissions and ownership">
    If you copied as root or switched users, the gateway may fail to read credentials. Ensure the state directory and workspace are owned by the user running the gateway.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Remote mode">
    If your UI points at a **remote** gateway, the remote host owns sessions and workspace. Migrate the gateway host itself, not your local laptop. See [FAQ](/help/faq#where-things-live-on-disk).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Secrets in backups">
    The state directory contains auth profiles, channel credentials, and other provider state. Store backups encrypted, avoid insecure transfer channels, and rotate keys if you suspect exposure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Verification checklist

On the new machine, confirm:

- [ ] `autopus status` shows the gateway running.
- [ ] Channels are still connected (no re-pairing needed).
- [ ] The dashboard opens and shows existing sessions.
- [ ] Workspace files (memory, configs) are present.

## Upgrade a plugin in place

In-place plugin upgrades preserve the same plugin id and config keys but may move on-disk state into the current layout. Plugin-specific upgrade guides live alongside their channels:

- [Matrix migration](/channels/matrix-migration): encrypted-state recovery limits, automatic snapshot behavior, and manual recovery commands.
