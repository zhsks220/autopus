# `autopus channels`

Manage chat channel accounts and their runtime status on the Gateway.

- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)

## Common commands

```bash
autopus channels list
autopus channels list --all
autopus channels status
autopus channels capabilities
autopus channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:123
autopus channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:<voice-channel-id>
autopus channels resolve --channel slack "#general" "@jane"
autopus channels logs --channel all
```

`channels list` shows chat channels only: configured accounts by default, with `installed`, `configured`, and `enabled` status tags per account. Pass `--all` to also surface bundled channels that have no configured account yet and installable catalog channels that are not yet on disk. Auth providers (OAuth + API keys) and model-provider usage/quota snapshots are no longer printed here; use `autopus models auth list` for provider auth profiles and `autopus status` or `autopus models list` for usage.

## Status / capabilities / resolve / logs

- `channels status`: `--channel <name>`, `--probe`, `--timeout <ms>`, `--json`
- `channels capabilities`: `--channel <name>`, `--account <id>` (only with `--channel`), `--target <dest>`, `--timeout <ms>`, `--json`
- `channels resolve`: `<entries...>`, `--channel <name>`, `--account <id>`, `--kind <auto|user|group>`, `--json`
- `channels logs`: `--channel <name|all>`, `--lines <n>`, `--json`

`channels status --probe` is the live path: on a reachable gateway it runs per-account
`probeAccount` and optional `auditAccount` checks, so output can include transport
state plus probe results such as `works`, `probe failed`, `audit ok`, or `audit failed`.
If the gateway is unreachable, `channels status` falls back to config-only summaries
instead of live probe output.

Do not use `autopus sessions`, Gateway `sessions.list`, or the agent
`sessions_list` tool as a channel socket-health signal. Those surfaces report
stored conversation rows, not provider runtime state. After a Discord provider
restart, a connected but quiet account may be healthy while no Discord session
row appears until the next inbound or outbound conversation event.

## Add / remove accounts

```bash
autopus channels add --channel telegram --token <bot-token>
autopus channels add --channel nostr --private-key "$NOSTR_PRIVATE_KEY"
autopus channels remove --channel telegram --delete
```

<Tip>
`autopus channels add --help` shows per-channel flags (token, private key, app token, signal-cli paths, etc).
</Tip>

`channels remove` only operates on installed/configured channel plugins. Use `channels add` first for installable catalog channels.
For runtime-backed channel plugins, `channels remove` also asks the running Gateway to stop the selected account before it updates config, so disabling or deleting an account does not leave the old listener active until restart.

Common non-interactive add surfaces include:

- bot-token channels: `--token`, `--bot-token`, `--app-token`, `--token-file`
- Signal/iMessage transport fields: `--signal-number`, `--cli-path`, `--http-url`, `--http-host`, `--http-port`, `--db-path`, `--service`, `--region`
- Google Chat fields: `--webhook-path`, `--webhook-url`, `--audience-type`, `--audience`
- Matrix fields: `--homeserver`, `--user-id`, `--access-token`, `--password`, `--device-name`, `--initial-sync-limit`
- Nostr fields: `--private-key`, `--relay-urls`
- Tlon fields: `--ship`, `--url`, `--code`, `--group-channels`, `--dm-allowlist`, `--auto-discover-channels`
- `--use-env` for default-account env-backed auth where supported

If a channel plugin needs to be installed during a flag-driven add command, Autopus uses the channel's default install source without opening the interactive plugin install prompt.

When you run `autopus channels add` without flags, the interactive wizard can prompt:

- account ids per selected channel
- optional display names for those accounts
- `Route these channel accounts to agents now?`

If you confirm bind now, the wizard asks which agent should own each configured channel account and writes account-scoped routing bindings.

You can also manage the same routing rules later with `autopus agents bindings`, `autopus agents bind`, and `autopus agents unbind` (see [agents](/cli/agents)).

When you add a non-default account to a channel that is still using single-account top-level settings, Autopus promotes account-scoped top-level values into the channel's account map before writing the new account. Most channels land those values in `channels.<channel>.accounts.default`, but bundled channels can preserve an existing matching promoted account instead. Matrix is the current example: if one named account already exists, or `defaultAccount` points at an existing named account, promotion preserves that account instead of creating a new `accounts.default`.

Routing behavior stays consistent:

- Existing channel-only bindings (no `accountId`) continue to match the default account.
- `channels add` does not auto-create or rewrite bindings in non-interactive mode.
- Interactive setup can optionally add account-scoped bindings.

If your config was already in a mixed state (named accounts present and top-level single-account values still set), run `autopus doctor --fix` to move account-scoped values into the promoted account chosen for that channel. Most channels promote into `accounts.default`; Matrix can preserve an existing named/default target instead.

## Login and logout (interactive)

```bash
autopus channels login --channel whatsapp
autopus channels logout --channel whatsapp
```

- `channels login` supports `--verbose`.
- `channels login` and `logout` can infer the channel when only one supported login target is configured.
- `channels logout` prefers the live Gateway path when reachable, so logout stops any active listener before clearing channel auth state. If a local Gateway is not reachable, it falls back to local auth cleanup.
- Run `channels login` from a terminal on the gateway host. Agent `exec` blocks this interactive login flow; channel-native agent login tools, such as `whatsapp_login`, should be used from chat when available.

## Troubleshooting

- Run `autopus status --deep` for a broad probe.
- Use `autopus doctor` for guided fixes.
- `autopus channels list` no longer prints model provider usage/quota snapshots. For those, use `autopus status` (overview) or `autopus models list` (per-provider).
- `autopus channels status` falls back to config-only summaries when the gateway is unreachable. If a supported channel credential is configured via SecretRef but unavailable in the current command path, it reports that account as configured with degraded notes instead of showing it as not configured.

## Capabilities probe

Fetch provider capability hints (intents/scopes where available) plus static feature support:

```bash
autopus channels capabilities
autopus channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:123
```

Notes:

- `--channel` is optional; omit it to list every channel (including extensions).
- `--account` is only valid with `--channel`.
- `--target` accepts `channel:<id>` or a raw numeric channel id and only applies to Discord. For Discord voice channels, the permission check flags missing `ViewChannel`, `Connect`, `Speak`, `SendMessages`, and `ReadMessageHistory`.
- Probes are provider-specific: Discord intents + optional channel permissions; Slack bot + user scopes; Telegram bot flags + webhook; Signal daemon version; Microsoft Teams app token + Graph roles/scopes (annotated where known). Channels without probes report `Probe: unavailable`.

## Resolve names to IDs

Resolve channel/user names to IDs using the provider directory:

```bash
autopus channels resolve --channel slack "#general" "@jane"
autopus channels resolve --channel discord "My Server/#support" "@someone"
autopus channels resolve --channel matrix "Project Room"
```

Notes:

- Use `--kind user|group|auto` to force the target type.
- Resolution prefers active matches when multiple entries share the same name.
- `channels resolve` is read-only. If a selected account is configured via SecretRef but that credential is unavailable in the current command path, the command returns degraded unresolved results with notes instead of aborting the entire run.
- `channels resolve` does not install channel plugins. Use `channels add --channel <name>` before resolving names for an installable catalog channel.
