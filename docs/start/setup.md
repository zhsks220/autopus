## TL;DR

Pick a setup workflow based on how often you want updates and whether you want to run the Gateway yourself:

- **Tailoring lives outside the repo:** keep your config and workspace in `~/.autopus/autopus.json` and `~/.autopus/workspace/` so repo updates don't touch them.
- **Stable workflow (recommended for most):** install the macOS app and let it run the bundled Gateway.
- **Bleeding edge workflow (dev):** run the Gateway yourself via `pnpm gateway:watch`, then let the macOS app attach in Local mode.

## Prereqs (from source)

- Node 24 recommended (Node 22 LTS, currently `22.16+`, still supported)
- `pnpm` required for source checkouts. Autopus loads bundled plugins from the
  `extensions/*` pnpm workspace packages in dev mode, so root `npm install` does
  not prepare the full source tree.
- Docker (optional; only for containerized setup/e2e - see [Docker](/install/docker))

## Tailoring strategy (so updates do not hurt)

If you want "100% tailored to me" _and_ easy updates, keep your customization in:

- **Config:** `~/.autopus/autopus.json` (JSON/JSON5-ish)
- **Workspace:** `~/.autopus/workspace` (skills, prompts, memories; make it a private git repo)

Bootstrap once:

```bash
autopus setup
```

From inside this repo, use the local CLI entry:

```bash
autopus setup
```

If you don't have a global install yet, run it via `pnpm autopus setup`.

## Run the Gateway from this repo

After `pnpm build`, you can run the packaged CLI directly:

```bash
node autopus.mjs gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

## Stable workflow (macOS app first)

1. Install + launch **Autopus.app** (menu bar).
2. Complete the onboarding/permissions checklist (TCC prompts).
3. Ensure Gateway is **Local** and running (the app manages it).
4. Link surfaces (example: WhatsApp):

```bash
autopus channels login
```

5. Sanity check:

```bash
autopus health
```

If onboarding is not available in your build:

- Run `autopus setup`, then `autopus channels login`, then start the Gateway manually (`autopus gateway`).

## Bleeding edge workflow (Gateway in a terminal)

Goal: work on the TypeScript Gateway, get hot reload, keep the macOS app UI attached.

### 0) (Optional) Run the macOS app from source too

If you also want the macOS app on the bleeding edge:

```bash
./scripts/restart-mac.sh
```

### 1) Start the dev Gateway

```bash
pnpm install
# First run only (or after resetting local Autopus config/workspace)
pnpm autopus setup
pnpm gateway:watch
```

`gateway:watch` starts or restarts the Gateway watch process in a named tmux
session and auto-attaches from interactive terminals. Non-interactive shells stay
detached and print `tmux attach -t autopus-gateway-watch-main`; use
`AUTOPUS_GATEWAY_WATCH_ATTACH=0 pnpm gateway:watch` to keep an interactive run
detached, or `pnpm gateway:watch:raw` for foreground watch mode. The watcher
reloads on relevant source, config, and bundled-plugin metadata changes. If the
watched Gateway exits during startup, `gateway:watch` runs
`autopus doctor --fix --non-interactive` once and retries; set
`AUTOPUS_GATEWAY_WATCH_AUTO_DOCTOR=0` to disable that dev-only repair pass.
`pnpm autopus setup` is the one-time local config/workspace initialization step for a fresh checkout.
`pnpm gateway:watch` does not rebuild `dist/control-ui`, so rerun `pnpm ui:build` after `ui/` changes or use `pnpm ui:dev` while developing the Control UI.

### 2) Point the macOS app at your running Gateway

In **Autopus.app**:

- Connection Mode: **Local**
  The app will attach to the running gateway on the configured port.

### 3) Verify

- In-app Gateway status should read **"Using existing gateway …"**
- Or via CLI:

```bash
autopus health
```

### Common footguns

- **Wrong port:** Gateway WS defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`; keep app + CLI on the same port.
- **Where state lives:**
  - Channel/provider state: `~/.autopus/credentials/`
  - Model auth profiles: `~/.autopus/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`
  - Sessions: `~/.autopus/agents/<agentId>/sessions/`
  - Logs: `/tmp/autopus/`

## Credential storage map

Use this when debugging auth or deciding what to back up:

- **WhatsApp**: `~/.autopus/credentials/whatsapp/<accountId>/creds.json`
- **Telegram bot token**: config/env or `channels.telegram.tokenFile` (regular file only; symlinks rejected)
- **Discord bot token**: config/env or SecretRef (env/file/exec providers)
- **Slack tokens**: config/env (`channels.slack.*`)
- **Pairing allowlists**:
  - `~/.autopus/credentials/<channel>-allowFrom.json` (default account)
  - `~/.autopus/credentials/<channel>-<accountId>-allowFrom.json` (non-default accounts)
- **Model auth profiles**: `~/.autopus/agents/<agentId>/agent/auth-profiles.json`
- **File-backed secrets payload (optional)**: `~/.autopus/secrets.json`
- **Legacy OAuth import**: `~/.autopus/credentials/oauth.json`
  More detail: [Security](/gateway/security#credential-storage-map).

## Updating (without wrecking your setup)

- Keep `~/.autopus/workspace` and `~/.autopus/` as "your stuff"; don't put personal prompts/config into the `autopus` repo.
- Updating source: `git pull` + `pnpm install` + keep using `pnpm gateway:watch`.

## Linux (systemd user service)

Linux installs use a systemd **user** service. By default, systemd stops user
services on logout/idle, which kills the Gateway. Onboarding attempts to enable
lingering for you (may prompt for sudo). If it's still off, run:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

For always-on or multi-user servers, consider a **system** service instead of a
user service (no lingering needed). See [Gateway runbook](/gateway) for the systemd notes.
